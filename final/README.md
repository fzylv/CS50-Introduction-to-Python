Built with Python and Tkinter, the game tests your knowledge of the Harry Potter universe. Players can choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, each with a set of multiple-choice questions that are displayed randomly. The game has a graphical user interface (GUI), and players are given their score, a message based on their performance, and a meme at the end of the quiz.
